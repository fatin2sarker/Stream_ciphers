# Stream_ciphers
A stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext digits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher digit stream (keystream). In a stream cipher, each plaintext digit is encrypted one at a time with the corresponding digit of the keystream, to give a digit of the ciphertext stream. I used my knowledge of pointers, ASCII85, and a pseudorandom generation algorithm to effectively employ the cipher. A key is used to encrypt the text, and the same key is used and we work backwards to decode the text.
